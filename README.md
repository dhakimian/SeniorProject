If you have g++ installed, simply typing 'make' while in the root directory of this
project should successfully compile main.cpp in src, and in that case typing
'./our\_game' should show up a window with a hello world picture for two seconds and
then quit.

If typing make doesn't work, email me at dhakimian@westmont.edu with the error message
and  what system you're using and I will see if I can make it work for you.

It should work for both linux and mac now, but I haven't tested windows.
